<p>A variety of socialist organizations sprung up throughout the later half of the 19th century,
    ranging from political parties to choir groups. In fact,
    many socialists were elected into governmental office by their constituency.
    But again, many of these socialists were ham-strung by the political process which was so evidently controlled by big business and the bi-partisan political machine.
    Tens of thousands of socialists broke ranks from their parties, rebuffed the entire political process, which was seen as nothing more than protection for the wealthy,
    and created anarchist groups throughout the country. Literally thousands of working people embraced the ideals of anarchism, which sought to put an end to all hierarchical structures (including government), emphasized worker controlled industry, and valued direct action over the bureaucratic political process. It is inaccurate to say that labor unions were “taken over” by anarchists and socialists,
    but rather anarchists and socialist made up the labor unions.</p>
